# Stocks-Trading-using-DRL

The DQN, a deep reinforcement algorithm has been implemented to learn the patterns in the stock market. The DQN(Deep Q Network) is mainly based on Q learning(Q values of the actions in a state) and the deep neural network which learns the Q values for each action in a state. The results were good but DQN learns policy with the help of Q values. Policy gradient which learns the policy directly. Right now I have share DQN for stocks and working on policy gradient for stocks trading.
